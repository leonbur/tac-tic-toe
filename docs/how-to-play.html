        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The big board is a 3x3 grid of small tic-tac-toe boards.</li>
          <li>When a player plays in a cell of a small board, the index of that cell is index of the small board that the next player must play in.</li>

          <li>Win small tic-tac-toe boards to claim that space in the big board.</li>
          <li>If sent to a completed board, your opponent can play in any available board.</li>

          <li>Players alternate turns, starting with X.</li>
          <li>If a small board results in a draw, it is considered a neutral space.</li>
